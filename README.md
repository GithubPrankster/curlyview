  <b> The simple image viewer themed after the protector of Mimiga</b>
</p>

`curlyview` is a C99 image viewing software shamelessly acting as a frontend for `stb_image.h`. Future esoteric image formats will be added as needed by Uneven.

### Usage

`./curlyview image.ext scale`

*image.ext* is any given format supported by `stb_image.h`, and *scale* is an unsigned value.

### Credits

`stb_image.h` is part of **Sean T. "Nothings" Barrett's** [STB](https://github.com/nothings/stb).

*Curly Brace* and others are characters from **Daisuke "Pixel" Amaya's** game [Cave Story](https://www.cavestory.org/).
